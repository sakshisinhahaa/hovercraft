# Hovercraft
A project that simulates the dynamics and control of a hovercraft using Python and the pygame library. This simulation demonstrates basic physics, user input-based navigation, and real-time rendering of a hovercraft in motion.

# Features
2D simulation of a hovercraft on a flat surface.

Realistic physics including thrust and angular movement.

Keyboard control interface (arrow keys to move).

Modular code structure for easy understanding and extension.

Simple and interactive GUI using pygame.

# Technologies Used
Python 3

pygame

# Controls
Use the following keys to operate the hovercraft:

UP Arrow – Forward thrust

LEFT Arrow – Rotate left

RIGHT Arrow – Rotate right

ESC – Quit the simulation
